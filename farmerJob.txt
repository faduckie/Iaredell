NARRATOR: You accept the job and make your way to the farm outside of town
NARRATOR: You spot the farmer working on some crops
FARMER: Good afternoon, young one. Have you spotted my request for help?
PLAYER: Yes. I've come to assist with your...demon problem.
FARMER: These pesky devils have been wrecking my crops every night, 
FARMER: and before I can catch them in the act they always disappear.
PLAYER: If you've never caught them in the act, how do you know it was them?
FARMER: Because they all make the same demonic noises, 
FARMER: and I know the sound of my crops being torn from their roots.
PLAYER: Alright, Iâ€™ll help.
NARRATOR: As night falls you spot two demons making their way toward the farmers crops. 
NARRATOR: You wait and see what they plan to do.
NARRATOR: Just before they can destroy the old man's crops, you leap out and attack

NARRATOR: The farmer looks at you confused.
FARMER: Whatever do you mean?
-------------------------
PLAYER: What can you tell me about those creatures?
NARRATOR: The farmer looks down thoughtfully before responding.
FARMER: I do recall hearing those pestering things talking about

FARMER: but they have such a unique sound and smell. 
FARMER: I'm sure you'll find them. Please, rid this town of such pests.
PLAYER: Thank you, sir. You've been of great help.
